# House-price-prediction


We have created our own dataset instead of using just toy dataset which gives always a high accuracy. By doing so we have learned how web scraping concepts have been used for developing dataset, organizing dataset and how to extract critical features which takes the model accuracy at high level. We have scraped a data from https://www.zolo.ca/toronto-real-estate and extract crucial information into csv files.

After this, we performed data cleaning and modeling. As we have created our own toy dataset, after data cleaning process, we analyzed the data and performed data visualization on it. We visualized the main information in form of pie charts, boxplot, scatterplot, histogram, etc. We found popular insights while performing data visualization on the dataset. We compared different features of houses accordingly to obtain accurate results. While doing this project, we understood that data visualization can make the audience understand the data in an effective way. In short, we cut the noise in our data and use only the useful patterns and values that can impact the business.

We can improve this by using feature Selection, which helps us in finding the most relevant feature to the house price. To improve accuracy, we can try some more regression techniques such as Support vector regression, Decision trees, and Deep learning models though we developed the model using only Linear Regression.
